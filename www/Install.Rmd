## Shiny-phyloseq Dependencies

If you are reading this, it is because you are interested
in launching/running a local instance of Shiny-phyloseq.
The Shiny-phyloseq "front end", the GUI web application,
will run on any modern web browswer.
Note that older versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer are **not supported**.
Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and others should be fine
for connecting to a Shiny-phyloseq session.
For running the Shiny-phyloseq "back end", you must have
the latest version of R installed on your system
as well as several additional R packages.

The following R code will install required packages on your local system.
Note that this assumes that you have an active internet connection and updated R installation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Dependency installation
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
installpkgs = c("phyloseq", "shiny", "data.table", "d3Network", "genefilter", "ggplot2", "grid",
  "gridExtra", "png", "RColorBrewer", "scales")
biocLite(pkgs = installpkgs)
```

Note that this will install the latest release version of phyloseq, but some of the functionality of `Shiny-phyloseq` may depend upon utilities in the newer development version. See [the phyloseq installation instructions](http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/install) and install the latest development release of phyloseq to guarantee full functionality.

The following lists the recommended version numbers of relevant packages:

```{r}
packageVersion("phyloseq")
packageVersion("shiny")
packageVersion("d3Network")
packageVersion("data.table")
packageVersion("genefilter")
packageVersion("ggplot2")
packageVersion("grid")
packageVersion("gridExtra")
packageVersion("png")
packageVersion("RColorBrewer")
packageVersion("scales")
```
