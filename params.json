Then click away!\r\n\r\nBrief steps:\r\n\r\n1. (Re)start RStudio by opening `server.R` or `ui.R`\r\n2. Click the \"Run App\" button that appears.\r\n3. Click the \"Open in Browser\" button above the new RStudio window that just launched.\r\n\r\nNote that any R installation/session can launch a Shiny app.\r\nFor alternative launch methods that don't use RStudio,\r\nsee \"[Running an App](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/)\".","google":"UA-32799541-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
