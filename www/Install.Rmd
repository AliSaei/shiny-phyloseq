This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R packages required to run the full-version of `Shiny + phyloseq`, and their versions:

```{r}
packageVersion("phyloseq")
packageVersion("shiny")
packageVersion("d3Network")
packageVersion("data.table")
packageVersion("genefilter")
packageVersion("ggplot2")
packageVersion("grid")
packageVersion("gridExtra")
packageVersion("png")
packageVersion("RColorBrewer")
packageVersion("scales")
```

If any of these are not installed on your system, use the following code to install. Note that this assumes that you have an active internet connection and updated R installation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Dependency installation
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
installpkgs = c("phyloseq", "shiny", "data.table", "d3Network", "genefilter", "ggplot2", "grid",
  "gridExtra", "png", "RColorBrewer", "scales")
biocLite(pkgs = installpkgs)
```

Note that this will install the latest release version of phyloseq, but some of the functionality of `Shiny + phyloseq` may depend upon utilities in the newer development version. See [the phyloseq installation instructions](http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/install) and install the latest development release of phyloseq to guarantee full functionality.
