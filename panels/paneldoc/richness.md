# Richness Panel

This panel is based on phyloseq's [plot_richness function](http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/plot_richness-examples.html).

Although the function name includes the word *richness*, 
which usually refers to the total number of species/OTUs
in a sample or environment -- either observed or estimated -- 
this panel and its underlying function are intended for
estimating and plotting alpha diversity in general.
